## Nasdaq ITCH

We have released our code for processing the Nasdaq ITCH data as an open-source Python 3
module available on [GitHub](https://github.com/vgreg/MeatPy). The documention is available on [Read The Docs](https://meatpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The documentation includes sample code to extract the metrics used in the paper.
## Thomson Reuters Tick History

The raw Thomson Reuters Tick History data (now Refinitv Tick History) was provided to us directly
by the [Securities Industry Research Centre of Asia-Pacific](https://www.sirca.org.au/) (SIRCA) on hard drives.
The dataset used in this paper is about 12TB in size (gzip-compressed CSV files) and required processing
on dedicated computing servers.
There is one daily TAS (time and sales file) per listing exchange. Our code first seperates
trades and quote in different files.

Because a good part of our code is server-specific (the part that loops over all files for processing
concurrently), for clarity we only provide the actual functions that execute the data cleaning and
processing.

The TRTH processing was done over the course of two years, and thus some code is in Python 2 format
while some code is in Python 3. The header comments in each file gives the necessary details.

### Code

The included Python files and their recommended execution order are:

**For trades:**

1. `ExtractTrades.py`
2. `ClassifyTrades.py`
3. `AlignDates.py`
4. `ExtractTradesAroundEarnings.py`
5. `ExtractTradesEarningsDescriptiveStats.py`
6. `ExtractTradesAfterEarningsResample.py`
7. `ExtractTradesAfterNewsBeforeOpen.py`

**For quotes:**

1. `ExtractQuotes.py`
2. `ExtractQuotesAroundEarnings.py`
3. `ExtractQuotesAfterEarningsResample.py`

## Ravenpack

We provide a Python Jupyter sample code (RavenPack.ipynb) on how to extract earnings announcement timestamps and analyst recommendation revision news from Ravenpack.

## IBES

We provide a Python Jupyter sample code (IBES_Data_Processing_JAR.ipynb) to retrieved earnings announcement dates and analyst earnings surprises.

## Sample stocks

We include the sample of stocks used in our analysis for the Journal of Accounting Research with their corresponding CRSP-PERMNO and TRTH identifier in a csv file.
